"""
Instead of having a list of lists, we could turn this information into a list of dictionaries. 
In each of these dictionaries, the key will be the name of the column, and the value will be the corresponding information in each row.  
It could look something like this:  
"""
people = [
    {
        "name": "Sabrina Green",
        "username": "sgreen",
        "phone": "802-867-5309",
        "department": "IT Infrastructure",
        "role": "Systems Administrator"
    },
    {
        "name": "Eli Jones",
        "username": "ejones",
        "phone": "684-348-1127",
        "department": "IT Infrastructure",
        "role": "IT Specialist"
    },
]

"""
Using a structure like this lets us do interesting things with our information thatâ€™s much harder to do with CSV files. 
For example, let's say we want to record more than one phone number for each person. 
Instead of using a single string for "phone", we could represent that data in another dictionary, like this: 
"""
people = [
    {
        "name": "Sabrina Green",
        "username": "sgreen",
        "phone": {
            "office": "802-867-5309",
            "cell": "802-867-5310"
        },
        "department": "IT Infrastructure",
        "role": "Systems Administrator"
    },
    {
        "name": "Eli Jones",
        "username": "ejones",
        "phone": {
            "office": "684-348-1127"
        },
        "department": "IT Infrastructure",
        "role": "IT Specialist"
    },
]

"""
Now, we can record multiple phone numbers per person, and give them descriptive names like "office" and "cell". 
This would be hard to store in a CSV file, because the data is not flat. 
To help us with that, there's a bunch of different formats that we can use to store our data when the structure isn't flat.
