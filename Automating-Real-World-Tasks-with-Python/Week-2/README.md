# Automating Real-World Tasks with Python | Week-2

To complete this module, you'll write a script that interacts with a running web service.  The web service is part of your company's website and is in charge of storing and displaying the customer reviews of the company.

The reviews are stored in text files in the local disk. Your script should open those files, process the information to turn it into the format expected by the web service, then send it to the web service to get stored.
