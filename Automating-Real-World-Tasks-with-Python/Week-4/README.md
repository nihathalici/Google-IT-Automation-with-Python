# Automating Real-World Tasks with Python | Week-4

To complete this module, you’ll 
* upload the new products to your online store. Images and descriptions should be uploaded separately, using two different web endpoints.
* Send a report back to the supplier, letting them know what you imported.

Since this process is key to your business's success, you need to make sure that it keeps running! So, you’ll also:

* Run a script on your web server to monitor system health.
* Send an email with an alert if the server is ever unhealthy.
